JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are widely used for authentication and information exchange between parties. Here are some important things to know about JWTs: -- stateless authentication.

Structure:

A JWT consists of three parts: header, payload, and signature.

(header.payload.signature).
1.header: type , algorithm 
2.payload: claims(statements abt user) and data 
         iss , sub , aud , exp,iast 
3.signature:The signature is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way.
The signature is created by encoding the header and payload, hashing the result, and then encrypting the hash using the secret key (for HMAC algorithms) or private key (for RSA/ECDSA algorithms).
